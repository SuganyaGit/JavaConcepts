/*

Before generics, we can store any type of objects in collection i.e. non-generic.
Now generics, forces the java programmer to store specific type of objects.

Advantage of Java Generics

There are mainly 3 advantages of generics. They are as follows:

1)	Type-safety : We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesnâ€™t allow to store other objects.

2)	Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.

3)  Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime.
     The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.
